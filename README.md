Goal is to build an MVP for a ride hailing application, similar to Uber.

The MVP solution is implemented into 3 parts:

**Core domain model**
This exercise should be used to design the core domain model and the state machine required to build out the solution. We recommend choosing Postgres as the database.

**API Design**
This exercise should be used to build on the previous domain model to expose it as a service. You may use REST/gRPC or any combination there of to create this solution.

**Admin**
This exercise builds on the previous exercise. You are encouraged to think deeply about the design of the system such that the business is not disrupted and there is auditability in the system.
